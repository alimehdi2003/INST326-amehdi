Week 1

The beginning week of the semester I used GEMENI AI to figure out what formatting mistakes I made in my print statements
that involved f strings and printing the numeric outputs of variables. I also needed to understand what syntax errors I made.
I asked GEMENI to help me understand python concepts that I found to be foreign and forgotten such as slicing as well understanding
the type() comamand. I was a bit stumped when it came to some of the exercise computations unsure why the output value wasn't rounded to two decimal places
debugging and asking me to show the correct format. I also found extracting specific parts of a string (prefix, section, cutter) using only .find()/.rfind() 
and slicing can be tricky. 

I usually prefer using Chat GPT but since GEMENI has already part of the jupyter file it more reliable to use rather paste code on Chat GPT
